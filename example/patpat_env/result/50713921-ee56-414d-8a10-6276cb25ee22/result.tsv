Cell rearrangement during angiogenesis requires suppression of actomyosin at cell-cell contacts via PI3-kinase.	b'Sprouting angiogenesis is a highly dynamic process which relies on the continuous interchange of endothelial cell relative position within the vascular sprout, a process mediated by cell rearrangements. Here we take advantage of a previous identified role of p110a/PI3K regulating endothelial cell motility to address how cell rearrangement and interaction regulate vessel growth. By using advanced fluorescent zebrafish models and a tamoxifen-inducible endothelial-specific gene targeting in the postnatal mouse retina, we demonstrate that inactivation of the p110a isoform of PI3K in endothelial cells is a good model to study cell shuffling in the growing vasculature.  We identify that a failure of endothelial cells to rearrange results in cell elongation and inability to stabilize new contacts upon anastomosis. Instead of rearrange, blockade of p110\xef\x81\xa1 signaling drive these cells to grow in a three dimension fashion by sending multiple protrusions which lack lumen and fail to stabilize upon anastomosis. Through a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches together with a global phosphoproteomic screen, we discover that p110a signaling stimulates cell rearrangements by suppressing actomyosin contractility in a myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) dependent manner.  Together, our findings highlight the importance of cell rearrangement orchestrating several steps within the angiogenic program and uncover a critical role of the p110a/MLCP axis to suppress actomyosin contractility.'	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD007060

Quantitative analysis of murine T-cells	1D-LC-MS/MS analysis of OGE-prefractionated and TMT labeled mouse samples consiting of 2 unstimulated and 2 stimulated T-cell samples. The acquired raw-files were converted to the mascot generic file (mgf) format using the msconvert tool (part of ProteoWizard, version 3.0.4624 (2013-6-3)). Using the MASCOT algorithm (Matrix Science, Version 2.4.0), the mgf files were searched against a decoy database containing normal and reverse sequences of the predicted SwissProt entries of mus musculus (www.ebi.ac.uk, release date 16/05/2012) and commonly observed contaminants (in total 33,832 sequences) generated using the SequenceReverser tool from the MaxQuant software (Version 1.0.13.13). The precursor ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.01 Da. The search criteria were set as follows: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues unless followed by proline), 2 missed cleavages were allowed, carbamidomethylation (C), TMT6plex (K and peptide n-terminus) were set as fixed modification and oxidation (M) as a variable modification. Next, the database search results were imported to the Scaffold Q+ software (version 4.1.1, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) and the protein false identification rate was set to 1% based on the number of decoy hits. Specifically, peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 94.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 1.0% by the scaffold local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 6.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 1.0% and contained at least 1 identified peptide. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet program (Nesvizhskii, et al, Anal. Chem. 2003; 75(17):4646-58). Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters. For quantification, acquired reporter ion intensities in the experiment were globally normalized across all acquisition runs. Individual quantitative samples were normalized within each acquisition run. Intensities for each peptide identification were normalized within the assigned protein. The reference channels were normalized to produce a 1:1 fold change. All normalization calculations were performed using medians to multiplicatively normalize data. A list of identified and quantified proteins is available in the xls file.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000543
Quantitative Proteome Responses to Oncolytic Reovirus in GM-CSF and M-CSF-Differentiated Bone Marrow-Derived Cells	To explore reovirus-macrophage interactions, we performed tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative temporal proteomics on mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) generated with 2 cytokines, M-CSF and GM-CSF, representing anti- and pro-inflammatory macrophages, respectively. We quantified 6,863 proteins across five time points in duplicate, comparing M-CSF (M-BMM) and GM-CSF (GM-BMM) in response to OV. We find that GM-BMMs have lower expression of key intrinsic proteins that facilitate an anti-viral immune response, express higher levels of reovirus receptor protein JAM-A and are more susceptible to oncolytic reovirus infection compared to M-BMMs. Interestingly, although M-BMMs are less susceptible to reovirus infection and subsequent cell death, they initiate an anti-reovirus adaptive T cell immune response comparable to that of GM-BMMs. Taken together, these data describe distinct proteome differences between these two macrophage populations in terms of their ability to mount anti-viral immune responses.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015203
Classically-activated macrophages rely on glucose-derived glycerol and external fatty acid for TAG synthesis	Altered lipid metabolism in macrophages is associated with various important inflammatory conditions. Although lipid metabolism is an important target for therapeutic intervention, the metabolic requirement involved in lipid accumulation during pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages remains incompletely characterized. We show here that macrophage activation with IFN¦Ã results in increased aerobic glycolysis, iNOS-dependent inhibition of respiration, and accumulation of triacylglycerol. Surprisingly, metabolite tracing with 13C-labeled glucose revealed that the glucose contributed to the glycerol groups in triacylglycerol (TAG), rather than to de novo synthesis of fatty acids. This is in stark contrast to the otherwise similar metabolism of cancer cells, and previous results obtained in activated macrophages and dendritic cells.  Our results establish a novel metabolic pathway whereby glucose provides glycerol to the headgroup of TAG during classical macrophage activation.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD017148
Cancer Associated Fibroblast-FAK regulates malignant cell metabolism	Breast and pancreatic cancers are characterised by profound metabolic changes1,2. Until recently, these changes have been ascribed to their intrinsic genetic profiles2-4. However, the contribution of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to cell metabolism has not been fully investigated5. Here, we provide clinical evidence that reduction in stromal Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) correlates with reduced overall survival in human breast and pancreatic cancer patients. To model this, we developed FSP-Cre+;FAKfl/fl mice where FAK was deleted in a subpopulation of CAFs. We establish that loss of CAF-FAK is sufficient to enhance tumour growth without affecting desmoplasia in orthotopically injected breast and pancreatic carcinomas. Additionally, deletion of CAF-FAK enhances disease progression in the MMTV-PyMT spontaneous model of breast cancer. Furthermore, despite this pro-tumourigenic effect, a significant reduction in tumour angiogenesis was observed in late-stage tumours, but not early-stage, size-matched tumours in FSP-Cre+;FAKfl/fl mice. This indicates that loss of CAF-FAK is sufficient to reduce malignant cell dependency on blood vessel support suggesting acquired metabolic alterations in cancer cells. Indeed, 18F-FDG-PET imaging and glucose flux analysis revealed enhanced glucose catabolism in early-stage, size-matched tumours in FSP-Cre+;FAKfl/fl mice in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that conditioned medium from FAK-null CAFs enhances glycolysis and glycolytic capacity in malignant cells. Proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis reveal enriched cytokine-mediated signalling pathways in FAK-null CAFs and subsequent enrichment of associated phosphopeptides in malignant cells, respectively. Overall, our data uncover a novel mechanism by which cytokines, regulated by CAF-FAK, can promote cancer growth and progression, and identify a new set of CAF-derived targets to interfere with cancer metabolism.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD008276
Insulin Induces Microtubule Stabilization and Regulates the Microtubule Plus-End Tracking Protein Network in Adipocytes	b'Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is known to involve microtubules, although the function of microtubules and the microtubule-regulating proteins involved in insulin action are poorly understood. CLASP2, a plus-end tracking microtubule-associated protein (+TIP) that controls microtubule dynamics, was recently implicated as the first +TIP associated with insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Here, using protein-specific targeted quantitative phosphoproteomics within 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we discovered that insulin regulates phosphorylation of the CLASP2 network members G2L1, MARK2, CLIP2, AGAP3 and CKAP5 as well as EB1, revealing the existence of a previously unknown microtubule-associated protein system that responds to insulin. To further investigate, G2L1 interactome studies within 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed that G2L1 co-immunoprecipitates CLASP2 and CLIP2 as well as the master integrators of +TIP assembly, the end binding (EB) proteins. Live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in adipocytes revealed G2L1 and CLASP2 colocalize on microtubule plus-ends. We found that while insulin increases the number of CLASP2-containing plus-ends, insulin treatment simultaneously decreases CLASP2-containing plus-end velocity. In addition, we discovered that insulin stimulates re-distribution of CLASP2 and G2L1 from exclusive plus-end tracking to \xe2\x80\x9ctrailing\xe2\x80\x9d behind the growing tip of the microtubule. Insulin treatment increases \xef\x81\xa1-tubulin Lysine 40 acetylation, a mechanism that was observed to be regulated by a counterbalance between GSK3 and mTOR, and also led to microtubule stabilization. Our studies introduce insulin-stimulated microtubule stabilization and plus-end trailing of +TIPs as new modes of insulin action and reveal the likelihood that a network of microtubule-associated proteins synergize to coordinate insulin-regulated microtubule dynamics.'	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011431

Proteogenomic characterization of developmental defects in the forebrain resulting from hyperactivated mTOR signaling	Hyperactivated mTOR signaling in the developing brain by mutation of TSC1 genes has multiple forms of pathology including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). To examine the downstream networks affected in the developing brain by hyperactivated mTOR signaling, we performed an integrated analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of forebrain of wild-type and TSC1/Emx1-Cre mouse. Our results provide novel and fundamental molecular bases for understanding hyperactivaed mTOR signaling-induced brain defects which can in turn facilitate identification of potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for mTOR signaling-related neurological disorders.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005768

Phosphoproteomics of MuSK Signaling	The development of the neuromuscular synapse depends on signaling processes which involve protein phosphorylation as a crucial regulatory event. The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK is the key signaling molecule at the neuromuscular synapse whose activity is required for the formation of a mature and functional neuromuscular synapse. However, the signaling cascade downstream of MuSK and the regulation of the different components is still poorly understood. Here we present data from a quantitative phosphoproteomics approach to study MuSK-dependent processes. Muscle cells were stimulated with the heparansulfate proteoglycan agrin, which activates MuSK and downstream signaling events. To get an insight into the signaling dynamics we used three different time points (unstimulated, 15 min, 60 min and 4 hrs).	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000558
A Bartonella effector acts as signaling hub for intrinsic STAT3 activation to trigger anti-inflammatory responses	Chronically infecting pathogens avoid clearance by the innate immune system by promoting premature transition from an initial pro-inflammatory response towards an anti-inflammatory tissue-repair response. STAT3, a central regulator of inflammation, controls this transition and thus is targeted by numerous chronic pathogens. Here we show that BepD, an effector of the chronic bacterial pathogen Bartonella henselae targeted to infected host cells, establishes an exceptional pathway for canonical STAT3 activation, thereby impairing secretion of pro-inflammatory TNF-¦Á and stimulating secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Tyrosine phosphorylation of EPIYA-related motifs in BepD facilitates STAT3 binding and activation via c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of Y705. The tyrosine-phosphorylated scaffold of BepD thus represents a signaling hub for intrinsic STAT3 activation that is independent from canonical STAT3 activation via transmembrane receptor-associated Janus kinases. We anticipate that our findings on a molecular shortcut to STAT3 activation will inspire new treatment options for chronic infections and inflammatory diseases.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD017119
Reshaping of the MHC-I ligandome in response to reovirus-based cancer immunotherapy	Oncolytic viruses (OVs), known for their cancer-killing characteristics, overturn tumor-associated defects in antigen presentation through the MHC class I pathway and induce protective neo antitumor CD8 T cell responses. Nonetheless, whether OVs shape the tumor MHC-I ligandome remains unknown. Here, we investigated if an OV induces the presentation of novel MHC I-bound tumor antigens (termed tumor MHC-I ligands). Using comparative mass spectrometry (MS)-based MHC-I ligandomics, we determined differential tumor MHC-I ligand expression following treatment with oncolytic reovirus in a murine ovarian cancer model. In vitro we found that reovirus induces the presentation of tumor MHC-I ligands in cancer cells. Concurrent multiplexed quantitative proteomics revealed that the changes in tumor MHC-I ligand presentation were mostly independent of reovirus-induced alterations of their source proteins. In an in vivo model, tumor MHC-I ligands were induced by reovirus in tumors but also, more importantly, analysis of spleens (a source of antigen-presenting cells) showed exclusive induction of most MHC-I ligands occurred in tumor-bearing mice. Finally, IFN¦Ã assays demonstrated immunogenicity of the reovirus-induced MHC-I ligands. OV-induced MHC-I responses may be exploited in combinatorial approaches to promote the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD013066
Assessing the Effects of Redox Modifier MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ on Cognition and Hippocampal Physiology Following Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Paclitaxel Treatment	Chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer can induce cognitive impairments often involving oxidative stress. The brain, as a whole, is susceptible to oxidative stress due to its high-energy requirements, limited anaerobic respiration capacities, and limited antioxidant defenses. The goal of the current study was to determine if the manganese porphyrin SOD mimetic MnTnBuOE-2-PyP (MnBuOE) could ameliorate the effects of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (AC-T) on mature dendrite morphology and cognitive function. Four-month-old female C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of chemotherapy followed by subcutaneous injections of MnBuOE. Four weeks following chemotherapy treatment, mice were tested for hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. After testing, brains were collected for Golgi staining and molecular analyses. MnBuOE treatment preserved spatial memory during the Morris water-maze. MnBuOE/AC-T showed spatial memory retention during all probe trials. AC-T treatment significantly impaired spatial memory retention in the first and third probe trial (no platform). AC-T treatment decreased dendritic length in the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of the hippocampus while AC-T/MnBuOE maintained dendritic length. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed affected protein networks associated with cell morphology and behavior functions in both the AC-T and AC-T/MnBuOE treatment groups	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD017271
Molecular effects of Vitamin C treatment in MSC80 cells, a suitable Schwann cell model	Schwann cells (SCs) are not only decisive to produce the axon-wrapping myelin sheath thus ensuring a proper nerve conduction but also exhibit with trophic function and can direct repair mechanisms of the peripheral nervous system. Consequently, suitable and well-characterized SC in vitro models are needed to perform appropriate pre-clinical studies including the investigation of the complex biochemical adaptations occurring in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) under different (patho)physiological conditions. MSC80 cells represent a SC line derived from mouse used in laboratories as a suitable in vitro system for neuropathological studies. As a comprehensive MSC80 protein catalogue remained elusive, here we introduce the most abundant 9532 proteins identified via mass spectrometry based protein analytics and thus provide the most comprehensive SC protein catalogue published thus far. Hereby, not only proteins causative for inherited neuropathies were covered but it has also been demonstrated that apart from cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, mitochondrial proteins and such belonging to the protein processing machinery are very well covered. Moreover, we addressed the suitability of MSC80 to examine molecular effect of a drug-treatment by analyzing the proteomic signature of Vitamin C-treated MSC80 cells. Proteomic findings along with further immunological and functional experiments support the concept of a beneficial role influence of Vitamin C on oxidative stress and identified TMX1 as an oxidative stress protective factor in SC which might represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention of PNS disorders with marked oxidative stress burden such as diabetic neuropathy.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006910

Proteomics analysis of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded tissues in the investigation of prostate cancer	b'As proteins represent cell function, proteomic analysis of prostate tissues may elucidate the mechanisms of prostate cancer (PCa) progression. To that end, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are valuable resources, but associated with large analytical difficulties due to protein cross-linking. Our aim is to characterize tissue protein changes associated with castration resistant PCa. This study focused at the development of a reliable protocol for the proteomic analysis of FFPE tissues which was followed by a pilot study using FFPE PCa clinical samples to investigate whether the optimized protocol can provide biologically relevant data in the context of PCa. Archival FFPE mouse tissues were processed using seven protein extraction protocols including combinations of homogenization means (beads, sonication, boiling) and buffers (Tris-HCl and Urea-Thiourea). The proteomics output was evaluated by SDS electrophoresis and high resolution LC-MS/MS analysis.

Extracted proteins were analyzed by GeLC-MS/MS followed by statistical and bioinformatics analysis using Cytsoscape and Open Targets tool. A combination of cell lysis by Tris-HCl, SDS and DTE with bead homogenization, sonication and boiling provided most efficient protein extraction from FFPE tissues based on protein identifications and reproducibility. Comparison between the FFPE and matched FF tissues showed a substantial overlap in protein identifications (502 common out of 1,216 IDs commonly identified in all FF samples and 530 IDs commonly identified in all FFPE samples) with a strong correlation in relative abundances (rs=0.846, p<.001).

Further disease association analysis using the Open Targets platform showed that 60% of the differentially expressed proteins in cancer versus normal adjacent were significantly associated with PCa. These results support the relevance of the proteomic findings in the context of PCa and the reliability of the optimized protocol for proteomics analysis of FFPE material. A large scale study including 160 clinical FFPE prostate cancer and benign tissues to define protein changes associated with aggressive PCa, is planned.'	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD015981

Hepatocyte-specific BIRC5 (Survivin)-knockout-mouse model, Subcellular fractionation	Experimental design For the label-free proteome analysis 17 mice were used composed of 5 individual wildtype mice for each condition before (WTprePHE) and after hepatectomy (WTpostPHE).  For the pre-hepatectomy condition four BIRC5-knockout mice (KOprePHE) were analyzed and three individuals after partial hepatectomy (KOpostPHE). For the LC-MS/MS analysis the samples were pre-fractionated by subcellular protein fractionatio. All samples corresponding to a subcellular fraction were analyzed in an individual label-free study.    Subcellular protein fractionation The subcellular fractions were generated using the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Tissue (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany).    Sample preparation and tryptic digestion 5ug of protein were loaded on a 18% Tris-glycine acrylamide gel (Anamed Electrophorese, Grosz-Bieberau, Germany).  The samples were allowed to run slightly into the gel (15 min, 100 V) and form a single band of approximately 3mm height.  The bands were stained with Coomassie, manually cut from the gel and digested with trypsin (Serva Electrophoresis, Heidelberg, Germany) in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.8) overnight at 37 degrees C.   LC-MS/MS Analysis  The RPLC-MS/MS analysis was performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) online coupled to an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany).  The injection volume was 15 ul of the sample, representing an amount of 250 ng peptides.The MS was operated in a data-dependent mode. Full scan MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 in the Orbitrap analyzer, while tandem mass spectra of the twenty most abundant peaks were measured in the linear ion trap after peptide fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (CID).	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000625

Phosphoproteomic analysis indicates that the B cell cytoskeleton is disrupted after exposure to mercury	Exposure to environmental mercury (Hg) currently may contribute to immune system dysfunction and autoimmune disease.  In this study phosphoproteomic analysis was used to investigate the impact of Hg2+ on a B cell line.  Treatments were with 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 uM Hg2+.   1713 phosphoproteins and 1937 confidently localized phosphorylation sites were identified.  161 phosphoproteins responded to Hg2+ treatment (ANOVA, 10% FDR).  Hg2+ at 50 and 100 uM stimulated Tyr phosphorylation on residues in the B-cell receptor complex as well as other systems.  At 20 uM and below Hg2+ primarily caused hyperphosphorylation of pSer/Thr residues and affected cytoskeletal systems.  Map Kinase 1 was exceptional as it was hyperphosphorylated at Tyr 185 following 20 uM and lower Hg2+ treatments.  These results contribute novel insight into the mechanism for immune system disruption by Hg2+.	http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD005415
