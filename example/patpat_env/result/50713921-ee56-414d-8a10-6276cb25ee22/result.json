Here we take advantage of a previous identified role of p110a/PI3K regulating endothelial cell motility to address how cell rearrangement and interaction regulate vessel growth. By using advanced fluorescent zebrafish models and a tamoxifen-inducible endothelial-specific gene targeting in the postnatal mouse retina, we demonstrate that inactivation of the p110a isoform of PI3K in endothelial cells is a good model to study cell shuffling in the growing vasculature.  We identify that a failure of endothelial cells to rearrange results in cell elongation and inability to stabilize new contacts upon anastomosis. Instead of rearrange, blockade of p110\uf061 signaling drive these cells to grow in a three dimension fashion by sending multiple protrusions which lack lumen and fail to stabilize upon anastomosis. Through a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches together with a global phosphoproteomic screen, we discover that p110a signaling stimulates cell rearrangements by suppressing actomyosin contractility in a myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) dependent manner.  Together, our findings highlight the importance of cell rearrangement orchestrating several steps within the angiogenic program and uncover a critical role of the p110a/MLCP axis to suppress actomyosin contractility.", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Cell lysis and trypsin digestion was performed as previously described (Wilkes et al., 2015). Briefly, primary mouse endothelial cells  were washed twice with cold PBS (supplemented with 1mM Na3VO4 and 1 mM NaF) and lysed with 300 \u00b5L of urea buffer (8M urea in 20 mM in HEPES pH 8.0 supplemented with 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1mM Na4P2O7 and 1 mM sodium \u03b2-glycerophosphate) for 30 min. Cell lysates were scraped from the flasks, snap frozen and stored at -80C until further processing. Cell lysates were further homogenized by sonication (60 cycles of 30s on 40s off; Diagenode Bioruptor\u00ae Plus, Liege, Belgium). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20.000 x g for 10 min at 5 oC and protein in the cell extracts was quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) analysis.  We used published methods for phosphoproteome analyses, (Gruhler et al., 2005; Larsen et al., 2005; Montoya et al., 2011) with some modifications. Briefly, 250 \u00b5g of protein were reduced and alkylated by sequential incubation with 10 mM DTT and 16.6 mM iodoacetamyde for 1h. Urea concentration was diluted to 2M with 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 80 \u00b5L of trypsin beads [(50% slurry of TLCK-trypsin (Thermo-Fisher Scientific; Cat. #20230)] pre-conditioned with 3 washes of 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) were added and samples were incubated for 16h at 37 oC with agitation. Trypsin beads were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 5 min at 5 oC. Following trypsin digestion, peptide solutions were desalted using 10 mg OASIS-HLB cartridges (Waters, Manchester, UK). Briefly, OASIS cartridges were accommodated in a vacuum manifold (-5 mmHg), activated with 1 mL ACN and equilibrated with 1.5 mL washing solution (1% ACN, 0.1% TFA). After loading the samples, cartridges were washed with 1 mL of washing solution. Phosphopeptides were eluted with 500 \u00b5L of glycolic acid buffer 1 (1 M glycolic acid, 50% ACN, 5% TFA) and subjected to phosphoenrichment.  Phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO2 (GL Sciences) as previously described with some modifications (Wilkes et al., 2015). Sample volumes were normalized to 1 mL using glycolic acid buffer 2 (1 M glycolic acid, 80% ACN, 5% TFA),  50 \u00b5L of TiO2 beads (50% slurry in 1% TFA) were added to the peptide mixture,  incubated for 5 min at room temperature with agitation and centrifuged for 30s at 1500xg. For each sample, 80% of the supernatant was transfer to fresh tubes and stored in ice and the remaining 20% used to resuspend the bead pellets that were loaded into an empty prewashed PE-filtered spin-tips (Glygen, MD, USA) and packed by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 3 min. After loading the remaining volume of the supernatant by centrifugation at 1500xg for 3 mim, spin tips were sequentially washed with 100 \u00b5L of glycolic acid buffer 2, ammonium acetate buffer (100 mM ammonium acetate in 25% ACN) and 10% ACN by RT centrifugation for 3 min at 1500xg. For phosphopeptide recovery, the addition 50 \u00b5L of 5% ammonium water followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 x g was repeated 4 times. Eluents were snap frozen in dry ice, dried in a speed vac (RVC 2-25, Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany) and peptide pellets stored at -80 oC.  Peptide pellets were resuspended in 12 \u00b5L of reconstitution buffer (20 fmol/\u00b5L enolase in 3% ACN, 0.1% TFA) and 5.0 \u00b5L were loaded onto an LC-MS/MS system consisting of a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC directly coupled to an Orbitrap Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were trap in a \u03bc-pre-column (catalog no 160454) and separated in an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap 100 ;catalog no 164569). The following parameters were used: 3% to 23% B gradient for 120 min and a flow rate of 0.3 \u00b5L/min.  As they eluted from the nano-LC system, peptides were infused into the online connected Q-Exactive Plus system operating with a 2.1s duty cycle. Acquisition of full scan survey spectra (m/z 375-1,500) with a 70,000 FWHM resolution was followed by, data-dependent acquisition in which the 20 most intense ions were selected for HCD (higher energy collisional dissociation) and MS/MS scanning (200-2,000 m/z) with a resolution of 17,500 FWHM. A 30 s dynamic exclusion period was enabled with an exclusion list with 10 ppm mass window. Overall duty cycle generated chromatographic peaks of approximately 30 s at the base, which allowed the construction of extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) with at least 10 data points.", "dataProcessingProtocol": "Peptide identification and quantification Mascot Daemon 2.5.0 was used to automate peptide identification from MS data. Peak list files (MGFs) from RAW data were generated with Mascot Distiller v2.5.1.0 and loaded into the Mascot search engine (v2.5) in order to match MS/MS data to peptides (Perkins et al., 1999). The searches were performed against the SwissProt Database (SwissProt_2012Oct.fasta for proteomics or uniprot_sprot_2014_08.fasta for phosphoproteomics analysis) with a FDR of ~1% and the following parameters: 2 trypsin missed cleavages, mass tolerance of \u00b110 ppm for the MS scans and \u00b125 mmu for the MS/MS scans, carbamidomethyl Cys as a fixed modification, PyroGlu on N-terminal Gln and oxidation of Met as variable modifications. For phosphoproteomics experiments Phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, and Tyr was also included as variable modifications. The in-house developed Pescal software was used for label-free peptide quantification (Cutillas, 2017), XICs for all the peptides identified across all samples were constructed with \u00b17 ppm and \u00b12 min mass and retention time windows, respectively. Peak areas from all XICs were calculated. Undetectable peptides were given an intensity value of 0. Values of 2 technical replicates per sample were averaged and intensity values for each peptide were normalized to total sample intensity. Normalized quantitative data were used to calculate fold changes between groups and statistical significance (assessed by Student\u2019s t-test) when necessary. Volcano plots and heatmatps were constructed in an R computing environment. KSEA Kinase substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA) was performed as described before (Casado et al., 2013). Briefly, peptides differentially phosphorylated between a set of samples (p < 0.05) were grouped into substrate sets known to be phosphorylated by a specific kinase as annotated in the PhosphoSite database (Hornbeck et al., 2015). To infer enrichment of substrate groups across sets of samples the hypergeometric test was used, followed by Benjamini Hochberg multiple testing correction. To calculate the fold difference of a given substrate group peptides were first normalized to those of the non-differentiated cells and then subjected to log2 transformation.", "projectTags": ["Biological"], "keywords": ["Mascot", "Pescal", "Phosphoproteomics", "Qexactive-plus", "Mice"], "doi": "10.6019/PXD007060", "submissionType": "COMPLETE", "license": "EBI terms of use", "submissionDate": "2017-07-17", "publicationDate": "2018-10-02", "submitters": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "Cell Signalling", "email": "p.m.casado-izquierdo@qmul.ac.uk", "country": "", "orcid": "", "name": "Pedro Casado-Izquierdo", "id": "400182"}], "labPIs": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "Centre for Heamato-Oncology / Barts Cancer Institute", "email": "p.cutillas@qmul.ac.uk", "country": "", "orcid": "", "name": "Pedro R.

We quantified 6,863 proteins across five time points in duplicate, comparing M-CSF (M-BMM) and GM-CSF (GM-BMM) in response to OV. We find that GM-BMMs have lower expression of key intrinsic proteins that facilitate an anti-viral immune response, express higher levels of reovirus receptor protein JAM-A and are more susceptible to oncolytic reovirus infection compared to M-BMMs. Interestingly, although M-BMMs are less susceptible to reovirus infection and subsequent cell death, they initiate an anti-reovirus adaptive T cell immune response comparable to that of GM-BMMs. Taken together, these data describe distinct proteome differences between these two macrophage populations in terms of their ability to mount anti-viral immune responses.", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Bone marrow cells were isolated from the femur and tibia bones, and briefly treated with Red blood cell-lysing ammonium chloride potassiumprior to being cultured in RPMI-1640 complete mediumCultures were then supplemented with either GM-CSF (20ng/ml) or M-CSF (100ng/ml) for 7 days to generate M1 and M2 macrophages, respectively. Macrophages were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and removed from plates by gentle scraping in 1mL of lysis buffer (2% SDS, 150mM NaCl, 5mM DTT, and 50mM Tris (pH 8.5)) and 1 protease inhibitor tablet (Sigma). Immediately following, cell samples were homogenized using a Tissue Ruptor (Qiagen, Germany) proceeded by brief sonication. Samples were then heated to 60 \u00baC for 30 minutes, cooled, and supplemented with iodoacetamide (14 mM) to alkylate cysteine residues before being subjected to methanol-chloroform precipitation and dried down using a vacuum centrifuge (Thermo Scientific). Next, samples were resuspended in 2 mL urea buffer (8 M Urea, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.8) by gentle drilling, followed by brief sonication, and kept on ice. Total protein content was measured using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). An aliquot of 100 ug of protein was diluted to 1.5 M urea, and digested in sequence grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at 37 \u00baC at a ratio of 1:100 trypsin: protein. The digest (peptides) was adjusted to < 3 pH using formic acid, was desalted using 60 mg solid phase 3 cc extraction cartridges (Waters, Milford, MA) and dried down. Dried peptides were resuspended in 100 mM HEPES, 30% acetonitrile and 10 mL of TMT10 reagents (Thermo Scientific) pre-aliquoted at a concentration of 20 mg/mL in anhydrous acetonitrile. The reaction was quenched with 0.5% hydroxylamine (Sigma), mixed equally, desalted using a 60 mg solid phase 3 cc extraction cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), and dried down. Peptides were fractionated using an Agilent 300-Extend, 4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 mm particle size C18 column (Agilent). A gradient of 5 to 40% acetonitrile (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 8) was applied at a flow rate of 800 mL/min using an Agilent 1100 pump. Fractions were collected every 0.38 min, beginning at 10 min; then, every 11th fraction was combined to a single sample to create 11 fractions, which were then desalted using home-made Stage-tips packed with Empore C18 extraction material (Sigma), then dried down and subjected to LC-SPS-MS3.  Each basic reverse phase fraction was resuspended in 0.1% formic acid and analyzed on a Thermo Fisher Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer with online chromatography using a Thermo Fisher EASY nLC. Peptides were separated on a 75 \u03bcm x 30 cm column packed with 0.5 cm of Magic C4 resin (Michrom Bioresources #PM5/64100/00) and 28 cm of C18 Accucore 120 resin (Thermo Fisher #16126-000). Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 300 nL/min using a gradient of 8%\u201326% acetonitrile (0.125% formic acid over 120 min followed by 10 min at 100% acetonitrile). Spectra were acquired using a synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3 method on the mass spectrometer (McAlister et al., 2014). In this method, MS1 scans were acquired over 400-1400 m/z, 120,000 resolution, 2e5 AGC target, 100 msec maximum injection time. The 10 most abundant MS1 ions from charge states 2-6 were selected for fragmentation using an isolation window of 0.5 Th, CID activation at 35% energy, rapid scan rate, 4000 AGC target, 30 s dynamic exclusion, and 150 msec maximum injection time.

The allowable precursor mass tolerance was 10 ppm and product ion mass tolerance was 1 Da. False positive rates were controlled using the target-decoy approach (Elias and Gygi, 2007) with a concatenated reversed database employing linear discriminant analysis to distinguish correct and incorrect peptide identifications based on XCorr, \u0394CN, peptide length, and charge state. Peptides were grouped into proteins and their multiplied linear discriminant analysis probabilities were used to sort proteins and filter to a 1% maximum false discovery rate.

CLASP2, a plus-end tracking microtubule-associated protein (+TIP) that controls microtubule dynamics, was recently implicated as the first +TIP associated with insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Here, using protein-specific targeted quantitative phosphoproteomics within 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we discovered that insulin regulates phosphorylation of the CLASP2 network members G2L1, MARK2, CLIP2, AGAP3 and CKAP5 as well as EB1, revealing the existence of a previously unknown microtubule-associated protein system that responds to insulin. To further investigate, G2L1 interactome studies within 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed that G2L1 co-immunoprecipitates CLASP2 and CLIP2 as well as the master integrators of +TIP assembly, the end binding (EB) proteins. Live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in adipocytes revealed G2L1 and CLASP2 colocalize on microtubule plus-ends. We found that while insulin increases the number of CLASP2-containing plus-ends, insulin treatment simultaneously decreases CLASP2-containing plus-end velocity. In addition, we discovered that insulin stimulates re-distribution of CLASP2 and G2L1 from exclusive plus-end tracking to \u201ctrailing\u201d behind the growing tip of the microtubule. Insulin treatment increases \uf061-tubulin Lysine 40 acetylation, a mechanism that was observed to be regulated by a counterbalance between GSK3 and mTOR, and also led to microtubule stabilization. Our studies introduce insulin-stimulated microtubule stabilization and plus-end trailing of +TIPs as new modes of insulin action and reveal the likelihood that a network of microtubule-associated proteins synergize to coordinate insulin-regulated microtubule dynamics.", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Immunoprecipitations and preparation for SDS-PAGE were performed exactly as previously described (PMID:28550165).

An aggregate data set containing all peak information from all samples was created from the aligned runs, which was then further narrowed down by selecting only +2, +3, and +4 charged ions for further analysis. The samples were then grouped in basal versus insulin. A peak list of fragment ion spectra from only the top eight most intense precursors of a feature was exported in Mascot generic file (.mgf) format and searched against the mouse SwissProt_2016_10 (23,550 entries) database using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 2.4). The search variables that were used were: 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ion masses and 0.5 Da for product ion masses; digestion with trypsin; a maximum of two missed tryptic cleavages; variable modifications of oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine; 13C=1. The resulting Mascot .xml file was then imported into Progenesis, allowing for peptide/protein assignment, while peptides with a Mascot Ion Score of <25 were not considered for further analysis. Precursor ion-abundance values for specific phosphopeptide ions were normalized to a selected series of standard peptide ions for the same target protein. The selected series of standard peptide ions had to conform to a set of rules previously established i.e. (1) detected by HPLC-ESI-MS with high intensity among the peptides for the target protein; (2) no missed cleavage observed; (3) no methionine in the sequence to avoid variability due to methionine oxidization and no N-terminal Gln residues; (4) cannot be a non-phosphorylated version of a peptide that was detected as being phosphorylated. Each phosphopeptide ion\u2019s normalized abundance value was normalized by the mean value of the respective basal sample and then expressed as a fold change over basal \u00b1SEM. When multiple peptide ions were present for a particular phosphopeptide ion, a representative peptide ion was chosen to reflect the effect of insulin. For the proof of principle dose curve test, no normalization was performed.", "projectTags": ["Biomedical"], "keywords": ["Clasp2 g2l1 insulin microtubules"], "doi": "10.6019/PXD011431", "submissionType": "COMPLETE", "license": "Creative Commons Public Domain (CC0)", "submissionDate": "2019-05-16", "publicationDate": "2019-06-13", "submitters": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "University of Arizona", "email": "langlais@deptofmed.arizona.edu", "country": "United States", "orcid": "0000-0003-1929-737X", "name": "Paul Langlais", "id": "40120110"}], "labPIs": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "Department of Medicine/Division of Endocrinology, University of Arizona College of Medicine", "email": "langlais@deptofmed.arizona.edu", "country": "", "orcid": "", "name": "Paul R Langlais", "id": "144530100"}], "affiliations": ["Department of Medicine/Division of Endocrinology, University of Arizona College of Medicine", "University of Arizona"], "instruments": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "MS", "accession": "MS:1002732", "name": "Orbitrap Fusion Lumos"}, {"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "MS", "accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "softwares": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "MS", "accession": "MS:1000531", "name": "X!

CLASP2, a plus-end tracking microtubule-associated protein (+TIP) that controls microtubule dynamics, was recently implicated as the first +TIP associated with insulin-regulated glucose uptake. Here, using protein-specific targeted quantitative phosphoproteomics within 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we discovered that insulin regulates phosphorylation of the CLASP2 network members G2L1, MARK2, CLIP2, AGAP3 and CKAP5 as well as EB1, revealing the existence of a previously unknown microtubule-associated protein system that responds to insulin. To further investigate, G2L1 interactome studies within 3T3-L1 adipocytes revealed that G2L1 co-immunoprecipitates CLASP2 and CLIP2 as well as the master integrators of +TIP assembly, the end binding (EB) proteins. Live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in adipocytes revealed G2L1 and CLASP2 colocalize on microtubule plus-ends. We found that while insulin increases the number of CLASP2-containing plus-ends, insulin treatment simultaneously decreases CLASP2-containing plus-end velocity. In addition, we discovered that insulin stimulates re-distribution of CLASP2 and G2L1 from exclusive plus-end tracking to \u201ctrailing\u201d behind the growing tip of the microtubule. Insulin treatment increases \uf061-tubulin Lysine 40 acetylation, a mechanism that was observed to be regulated by a counterbalance between GSK3 and mTOR, and also led to microtubule stabilization. Our studies introduce insulin-stimulated microtubule stabilization and plus-end trailing of +TIPs as new modes of insulin action and reveal the likelihood that a network of microtubule-associated proteins synergize to coordinate insulin-regulated microtubule dynamics.", "website": "http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD011431"}, "PXD014607": {"accession": "PXD014607", "title": "Systematic discovery of endogenous ribonucleoprotein complexes - RNA DIF-FRAC mouse embryonic stem cell", "additionalAttributes": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "PRIDE", "accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2019/10/PXD014607"}], "projectDescription": "The associated files are mass spec data from size exclusion chromatographic separations of mouse embryonic stem cells with and without RNAse A treatment.", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Mouse J1 ES cells (ATCC SCRC-1010) were cultured in DMEM containing 18% FBS, 50U/mL of penicillin/streptomycin with 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential aminio acid, 1% nucleosides, 0.1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and 1,000 U/mL recombinant LIF.

To examine the downstream networks affected in the developing brain by hyperactivated mTOR signaling, we performed an integrated analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of forebrain of wild-type and TSC1/Emx1-Cre mouse. Our results provide novel and fundamental molecular bases for understanding hyperactivaed mTOR signaling-induced brain defects which can in turn facilitate identification of potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for mTOR signaling-related neurological disorders.", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "The telencephalon tissues of Tsc1/Emx1-cre CKO and control mice were dried and then homogenized with the lysis buffer and a Complete Mini Protease inhibitor tablet. The lysate was ultracentrifuged at 45,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for an hour. Protein concentration was determined from the resulting supernatant by DC protein assay. The protein sample was then reduced in 0.5 M DTT (100 \u00b5l) for 50 minutes at 37 \u00b0C, followed by addition of 1.5 \u00b5l of 1M iodoacetamide and incubation in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature for alkylation. The resulting sample was subjected to in-solution tryptic digestion [1:50 enzyme-to-protein ratio (w/w)] with incubation at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The peptide samples were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 10 minutes at room temperature, and the resulting aqueous solution was desalted using solid-phase extraction with a reverse-phase tC18 SepPak solid-phase extraction cartridge. Finally, peptides were eluted with 50% ACN 0.5% HAcO and then dried in a Speed-Vac with resuspension in 0.1% formic acid. The samples were stored at -20 \u00b0C before LC-MS/MS analysis.  All peptide samples were separated on a Thermo EASY-nLC 1000 equipped with an analytical column and a trap column. The operation temperature of the analytical column was at 50 \u00b0C. The flow rate was set to 300 nL/min. The solvents A and B were 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile in water and 0.1% formic acid and 2% water in acetonitrile, respectively. For the global proteome analysis, 120 min gradient was used. The eluted peptides from LC were analyzed using Q-Exactive\u2122 hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source. For the ionization of the eluted peptides, the electric potential of electrospray ionization was kept at 1.7 kV, and the temperature of desolvation capillary was set to 270 \u00b0C. Q-Exactive was operated in the data dependent mode with survey scans acquired for the mass range of 450-2000 Thomsons (Th) at a resolution of 70,000. Up to the top 10 most abundant ions from the survey scan were selected with an isolation window of 2.0 Th and fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision energies of 25 and the exclusion duration of 10 s. The MS/MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 17,500. Maximum ion injection times were 100 ms and 50 ms for full MS and MS/MS scan, respectively. Automated gain control (AGC) target value was set to 1.0 \u00d7 106 and 1.0 \u00d7 105 for full MS and MS/MS scan, respectively.", "dataProcessingProtocol": "Peptide identification: The fragmentation spectra were created based on mzXML file using msconvert (ProteoWizard release: 3.0.4323). MS data were first analyzed using post-experiment monoisotopic mass refinement (PE-MMR) to assign accurate precursor mass to tandem MS data. MS/MS spectra were searched against a composite database containing Swiss-Prot entries of the  mouse reference proteome (UniProtKB release 2016_02, 25,010 entries) and 179 common contaminants in the target-decoy setting using MS-GF+ Beta (v10089) search engine under the following parameters: semi-tryptic, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. The search results of 24 LC-MS/MS datasets were all combined, and the target-decoy analysis was performed on the combined dataset to obtain peptides with the false discovery rate (FDR) \u2264 0.01. Label-free peptide quantification: To assign MS intensity to peptide identification, an MS intensity-based label-free quantification method was applied to 24 LC-MS/MS datasets. Briefly, through PE-MMR analysis, MS features of a peptide that appeared over a period of LC elution time in an LC-MS/MS experiment were grouped into a unique mass class (UMC). Ideally, each UMC corresponds to a peptide and contains the ions corresponding to the peptide, together with their mass spectral features, such as charge states, abundances (intensity), scan numbers, and measured monoisotopic masses. For each UMC, we obtained the mass by calculating the intensity-weighted average of the monoisotopic masses of all the ions in the UMC. For the peptide corresponding to the UMC, its abundance was estimated as the summation of the abundances of all the ions in the UMC (UMC intensity). The refined precursor masses of the MS/MS spectra by PE-MMR were matched to the UMC masses and then were replaced with those of UMCs. In this process, MS/MS spectra information was linked to the matched UMC. The linked MS/MS spectra were assigned with a peptide sequence (peptide ID) with a FDR \u2264 0.01 after MS-GF+ searching and target-decoy analysis. The peptide ID was assigned to the UMC, and the UMC intensity was assigned to the peptide ID. Assignment of UMCs by master AMT database: To assign the peptide IDs to unidentified UMCs, the master accurate mass and time tag (AMT) database (DB) was constructed and utilized. Briefly, the information about UMCs with peptide IDs from 24 LC-MS/MS data (triplicate LC-MS/MS experiments of 8 samples) was compiled into the master AMT-DB. The AMTs are unique peptide sequences whose monoisotopic masses and normalized elution times (NETs) are experimentally determined. For each AMT whose corresponding peptides were measured multiple times, the average mass and the median NET were recorded. We then mapped unidentified UMCs to AMTs in the master AMT DB with \u00b110 ppm of mass and \u00b10.02 of NET tolerances, and 3.0 of Excorr threshold. For each unidentified UMC matched to an AMT, the peptide ID for the AMT was assigned together with all information for the AMT (UMC mass, NET and Excorr). Alignment of the identified peptides: After the assignment of unidentified UMCs using the master AMT DB, we combined the assigned and identified UMCs from LC-MS/MS datasets into an n\u00d7m alignment table (peptide IDs for n UMCs and UMC intensities in m samples). The missing value in the alignment table means that the peptide was not identified in the corresponding datasets. For the missing values in each row of the table, we further searched for the UMCs that could be matched to the aligned UMCs based on their UMC masses and NETs with the following tolerance: \u00b110 ppm and \u00b10.01 across the technical replicates, and \u00b110 ppm and \u00b10.02 across the biological replicates. Quantile normalization was performed for UMC intensities in the alignment table to correct systematic variations of peptide abundance across datasets. To evaluate reproducibility of LC-MS/MS analysis, two types of similarity scores between LC-MS/MS datasets were calculated by measuring the overlap of detected peptides and their intensity values.", "projectTags": ["Biological", "Biomedical"], "keywords": ["Lc-msms", "Mouse", "Brain", "Forebrain"], "doi": "10.6019/PXD005768", "submissionType": "COMPLETE", "license": "EBI terms of use", "submissionDate": "2017-01-23", "publicationDate": "2018-08-16", "submitters": [{"title": "Mr", "affiliation": "Postech", "email": "hyung926@postech.ac.kr", "country": "", "orcid": "", "name": "Minhyung Kim", "id": "61050155"}], "labPIs": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "Center for Plant Aging Research, Institute for Basic Science, and Department of New Biology, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Daegu 42988, Republic of Korea", "email": "dhwang@dgist.ac.kr", "country": "", "orcid": "", "name": "Daehee Hwang", "id": "63220100"}], "affiliations": ["Center for Plant Aging Research, Institute for Basic Science, and Department of New Biology, Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Daegu 42988, Republic of Korea", "Postech"], "instruments": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "MS", "accession": "MS:1001911", "name": "Q Exactive"}], "softwares": [], "quantificationMethods": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "PRIDE", "accession": "PRIDE:0000436", "name": "Spectrum counting"}], "countries": ["South Korea"], "sampleAttributes": [], "organisms": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "NEWT", "accession": "10090", "name": "Mus musculus (mouse)"}], "organismParts": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "BTO", "accession": "BTO:0000142", "name": "Brain"}, {"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "CL", "accession": "UBERON:0001890", "name": "Forebrain"}], "diseases": [], "references": [{"referenceLine": "Shin J, Kim M, Jung HJ, Cha HL, Suh-Kim H, Ahn S, Jung J, Kim Y, Jun Y, Lee S, Hwang D, Kim J.

Phosphopeptides were again desalted with microspin C18 cartridges.", "dataProcessingProtocol": "LC-MS/MS analysis. Chromatographic separation of peptides was carried out using an EASY nano-LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a heated 30 cm RP-HPLC column (75 \u03bcm x 45 cm) packed in-house with 1.9 \u00b5m C18 resin (Reprosil-AQ Pur, Dr.Maisch). Phosphopeptide samples were analyzed per LC-MS/MS run using a linear gradient ranging from 98% solvent A (0.15% formic acid) and 2% solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 2% water, 0.15% formic acid) to 30% solvent B over 120 min at a flow rate of 200 nl min-1. Peptides derived from immunoprecipitation experiments were analyzed separated on a 60 min gradient. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a dual pressure LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source (both Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each MS1 scan (acquired with the Orbitrap) was followed by collision-induced dissociation (CID, acquired in the LTQ) of the 10 most abundant precursor ions with dynamic exclusion for 30 s. For phosphopeptide analysis, the 10 most abundant precursor ions were subjected to CID with enabled multistage activation. Total cycle time was approximately 2 s. For MS1, 106 ions were accumulated in the Orbitrap cell over a maximum time of 300 ms and scanned at a resolution of 240\u2019000 FWHM (at 400 m z-1). MS2 scans were acquired using the rapid scan mode, a target setting of 104 ions, and accumulation time of 25 ms. Single charged ions and ions with unassigned charge state were excluded from triggering MS2 events. The normalized collision energy was set to 35%, and one microscan was acquired for each spectrum.  Label-free Quantification and Database Searching. The acquired raw-files were imported into the Progenesis software tool (Nonlinear Dynamics) for label-free quantification using the default parameters. MS2 spectra were exported directly from Progenesis in mgf format and searched using the MASCOT algorithm (Matrix Science) against a decoy database containing normal and reverse sequences of the predicted SwissProt entries of Mus musculus (http://www.ebi.ac.uk) and commonly observed contaminants generated using the Sequence Reverser tool from the MaxQuant software. The precursor ion tolerance was set to 10 ppm and fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.6 Da. The search criteria were set as follows: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues unless followed by proline), 2 missed cleavages were allowed, carbamidomethylatiI (C) was set as fixed modification and phosphorylation (S, T, Y) or oxidation (M) as a variable modification for TiO2 enriched or not enriched samples, respectively. Finally, the database search results were exported as a xml-file and imported back to the Progenesis software for MS1 feature assignment. For phosphopeptide quantification, a csv-file containing the MS1 peak abundances of all detected features was exported and for not enriched samples, a csv-file containing all protein measurements based on the summed feature intensities of all identified peptides per protein was created. Importantly, the Progenesis software was set that proteins identified by similar sets of peptides are grouped together and that only non-conflicting peptides with specific sequences for single proteins in the database were employed for protein quantification. Both files were further processed using the in-house developed SafeQuant R script (https://github.com/eahrne/SafeQuant). In brief, the software sets the identification level False Discovery Rate to 1% (based on the number of decoy protein sequence database hits) and normalizes the identified MS1 peak abundances (extracted ion chromatogram, XIC) across all samples, i.e. the summed XIC of all confidently identified peptide features is scaled to be equal for all LC-MS runs. In the case of the IP experiments, the summed XIC confidently identified peptide features, matching the bait proteins, were used for normalization. In the case of phosphoproteomics, all quantified phosphopeptides/proteins are assigned an abundance ratio for each time point, based on the median XIC per time point. The statistical significance of each ratio is given by its q-value (false discovery rate adjusted p values), obtained by calculating modified t-statistic p values and adjusting for multiple testing. The location of the phosphorylated residues was automatically assigned by MASCOT (score >10).", "projectTags": ["Biological", "Biomedical"], "keywords": ["Signaling", "Bartonella", "Stat3"], "doi": "10.6019/PXD017119", "submissionType": "COMPLETE", "license": "Creative Commons Public Domain (CC0)", "submissionDate": "2020-01-15", "publicationDate": "2020-02-12", "submitters": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "Proteomics Core Facility", "email": "alex.schmidt@unibas.ch", "country": "Switzerland", "orcid": "0000-0002-3149-2381", "name": "Alexander Schmidt", "id": "710188"}], "labPIs": [{"title": "Dr", "affiliation": "Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland", "email": "alex.schmidt@unibas.ch", "country": "", "orcid": "", "name": "Alexander Schmidt", "id": "176010100"}], "affiliations": ["Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland", "Proteomics Core Facility"], "instruments": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "MS", "accession": "MS:1001910", "name": "LTQ Orbitrap Elite"}], "softwares": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "MS", "accession": "MS:1000531", "name": "Scaffold Scaffold_4.10.0"}, {"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "MS", "accession": "MS:1000531", "name": "Mascot 2.4.1"}], "quantificationMethods": [], "countries": [], "sampleAttributes": [], "organisms": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "NEWT", "accession": "10090", "name": "Mus musculus (mouse)"}], "organismParts": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "BTO", "accession": "BTO:0000214", "name": "Cell culture"}], "diseases": [], "references": [{"referenceLine": "Sorg I, Schmutz C, Lu YY, Fromm K, Siewert LK, B\u00f6gli A, Strack K, Harms A, Dehio C.

Nonetheless, whether OVs shape the tumor MHC-I ligandome remains unknown. Here, we investigated if an OV induces the presentation of novel MHC I-bound tumor antigens (termed tumor MHC-I ligands). Using comparative mass spectrometry (MS)-based MHC-I ligandomics, we determined differential tumor MHC-I ligand expression following treatment with oncolytic reovirus in a murine ovarian cancer model. In vitro we found that reovirus induces the presentation of tumor MHC-I ligands in cancer cells. Concurrent multiplexed quantitative proteomics revealed that the changes in tumor MHC-I ligand presentation were mostly independent of reovirus-induced alterations of their source proteins. In an in vivo model, tumor MHC-I ligands were induced by reovirus in tumors but also, more importantly, analysis of spleens (a source of antigen-presenting cells) showed exclusive induction of most MHC-I ligands occurred in tumor-bearing mice. Finally, IFN\u03b3 assays demonstrated immunogenicity of the reovirus-induced MHC-I ligands.

Lyophilized peptides were solubilized in 12 \u03bcL of 1% formic acid and analyzed by LC\u2013MS/MS. For each antibody eluate, an aliquot of 1 \u03bcL of peptides was injected onto a 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 30 cm column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) self-packed with 4 \u03bcm, 90 \u00c5, Proteo C18 material (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).

Nonetheless, whether OVs shape the tumor MHC-I ligandome remains unknown. Here, we investigated if an OV induces the presentation of novel MHC I-bound tumor antigens (termed tumor MHC-I ligands). Using comparative mass spectrometry (MS)-based MHC-I ligandomics, we determined differential tumor MHC-I ligand expression following treatment with oncolytic reovirus in a murine ovarian cancer model. In vitro we found that reovirus induces the presentation of tumor MHC-I ligands in cancer cells. Concurrent multiplexed quantitative proteomics revealed that the changes in tumor MHC-I ligand presentation were mostly independent of reovirus-induced alterations of their source proteins. In an in vivo model, tumor MHC-I ligands were induced by reovirus in tumors but also, more importantly, analysis of spleens (a source of antigen-presenting cells) showed exclusive induction of most MHC-I ligands occurred in tumor-bearing mice. Finally, IFN\u03b3 assays demonstrated immunogenicity of the reovirus-induced MHC-I ligands.

The brain, as a whole, is susceptible to oxidative stress due to its high-energy requirements, limited anaerobic respiration capacities, and limited antioxidant defenses. The goal of the current study was to determine if the manganese porphyrin SOD mimetic MnTnBuOE-2-PyP (MnBuOE) could ameliorate the effects of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (AC-T) on mature dendrite morphology and cognitive function. Four-month-old female C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of chemotherapy followed by subcutaneous injections of MnBuOE. Four weeks following chemotherapy treatment, mice were tested for hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance in the Morris water maze. After testing, brains were collected for Golgi staining and molecular analyses. MnBuOE treatment preserved spatial memory during the Morris water-maze. MnBuOE/AC-T showed spatial memory retention during all probe trials. AC-T treatment significantly impaired spatial memory retention in the first and third probe trial (no platform). AC-T treatment decreased dendritic length in the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of the hippocampus while AC-T/MnBuOE maintained dendritic length. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed affected protein networks associated with cell morphology and behavior functions in both the AC-T and AC-T/MnBuOE treatment groups", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "One day after the last MnBuOE injection, a small cohort (n = 4 per) were sacrificed for immediate protein analysis. The hippocampus was removed and placed in 400 \u00b5l of RIPA lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mM NaCl). The tissue was homogenized on ice, incubated for 30 min on ice, and then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and stored at -80 \u00b0C until processing. The Compat-AbleTM Protein Assay Preparation Reagent Kit (Thermo Scientific \u2122) was used to eliminate EGTA as an interfering substance for the BCA Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific \u2122). Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE using the 4-15% Criterion\u2122 TGX\u2122 Precast Midi Protein Gel, 18-well, 30 uL (Bio-Rad) ran at 120V for 75 min. The gel was stained using Coomassie Blue staining (Bio-Rad). The samples were then sent to the UAMS Proteomics Core for further processing for mass spectrometry. GeLC-MS/MS Analysis Each SDS-PAGE gel lane was sectioned into 12 segments of equal volume. Each segment was subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion as follows. Gel slices were destained in 50% methanol (Fisher), 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by reduction in 10 mM Tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (Pierce) and alkylation in 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich). Gel slices were then dehydrated in acetonitrile (Fisher), followed by addition of 100 ng porcine sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubation at 37oC for 12-16 hours. Peptide products were then acidified in 0.1% formic acid (Pierce). Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase XSelect CSH C18 2.5 um resin (Waters) on an in-line 150 x 0.075 mm column using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Peptides were eluted using a 30 min gradient from 97:3 to 67:33 buffer A: B ratio.  [Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid, 0.5% acetonitrile; buffer B = 0.1% formic acid, 99.9% acetonitrile.] Eluted peptides were ionized by electrospray (2.15 kV) followed by MS/MS analysis using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo) in top-speed data-dependent mode. MS data were acquired using the FTMS analyzer in profile mode at a resolution of 240,000 over a range of 375 to 1500 m/z. Following HCD activation, MS/MS data were acquired using the ion trap analyzer in centroid mode and normal mass range with precursor mass-dependent normalized collision energy between 28.0 and 31.0.", "dataProcessingProtocol": "Proteins were identified and quantified by searching the UniprotKB database restricted to Mus musculus using MaxQuant (version 1.6.5.0, Max Planck Institute). The database search parameters included selecting the MS1 reporter type, trypsin digestion with up to two missed cleavages, fixed modifications for carbamidomethyl of cysteine, variable modifications for oxidation on methionine and acetyl on N-terminus, the precursor ion tolerance of 5 ppm for the first search and 3 ppm for the main search, and label-free quantitation with iBAQ normalized intensities. Peptide and protein identifications were accepted using the 1.0% false discovery rate identification threshold. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii et al. 2003).  MaxQuant iBAQ intensities for each sample were median-normalized so the medians were equal to the sample with the maximum median. Median-normalized iBAQ intensities were then imported into Perseus (version 1.6.1.3, Max Planck Institute) to perform log2 transformation and impute the missing values using a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2 standard deviations. The Linear Models for Microarray Data (limma) Bioconductor package was used to calculate differential expression among the experimental conditions using the lmFit and eBayes functions (Nesvizhskii et al. 2003; Ritchie et al. 2015).

Consequently, suitable and well-characterized SC in vitro models are needed to perform appropriate pre-clinical studies including the investigation of the complex biochemical adaptations occurring in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) under different (patho)physiological conditions. MSC80 cells represent a SC line derived from mouse used in laboratories as a suitable in vitro system for neuropathological studies. As a comprehensive MSC80 protein catalogue remained elusive, here we introduce the most abundant 9532 proteins identified via mass spectrometry based protein analytics and thus provide the most comprehensive SC protein catalogue published thus far. Hereby, not only proteins causative for inherited neuropathies were covered but it has also been demonstrated that apart from cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, mitochondrial proteins and such belonging to the protein processing machinery are very well covered. Moreover, we addressed the suitability of MSC80 to examine molecular effect of a drug-treatment by analyzing the proteomic signature of Vitamin C-treated MSC80 cells. Proteomic findings along with further immunological and functional experiments support the concept of a beneficial role influence of Vitamin C on oxidative stress and identified TMX1 as an oxidative stress protective factor in SC which might represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention of PNS disorders with marked oxidative stress burden such as diabetic neuropathy.", "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Sample preparation for shotgun proteomics Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), supplemented with complete mini EDTA-free and phosphoStop (both from Roche). Following brief sonication (Vibra-Cell Ultrasonic Processor, 4 second pulses for 20 seconds) and a further incubation on ice for 30 min, the homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 rcf and 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Supernatant was collected and protein concentration was determined via BCA assay at 570 nm wavelength according to the manufacture\u2019s instruction (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific). Afterwards, protein cysteine residues were reduced with dithiothreitol (F.c 10 mM DTT) at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min, and subsequently, the new generated free thiols were carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide (F.c. 30 mM IAA) for 30 minutes in the dark. Next filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) was carried out. More precisely, 100 \u00b5g of proteins were subjected onto 30 kDa weight cut-off (MWCO) membrane filer (Pall Corporation, Nanosep) together with 100 \u00b5l of 8 M Urea in Tris.HCl buffer (pH 8.5), centrifugation at 13.500 x g at RT was applied to wash the proteins, the washing step was performed 3 times with Urea buffer. Afterwards, proteins were washed and concentrated with 50 mM aminobicarbonate (NH4HCO3) buffer (pH 7.8) for 3 times in the same manner as with urea buffer. Lastly, proteins were subjected into digestion with 100 \u00b5l of digestion mixture comprising of 4 \u00b5g of trypsin (Promega, Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade) in 2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 GuHCl and 50 mM ABC (pH 7.8) for 14 hours at 37 \u00b0C.  Next day, peptide solution was collected by centrifugation for 13.500 x g for 15 min, followed by 2 other centrifugation steps with 50 \u00b5l of 50 mM ABC buffer (pH 7.8) and 50 \u00b5l of ultra-pure H2O.

Peptide fractionation with pH8 and LC-MS/MS analysis 30 \u00b5g peptides were desalted with the OASIS HLB Cartridge (Waters) and then dried under the SpeedVac Concentrator System (Thermo Scientific). Afterwards, the dried peptide pellet was resuspended into 15 \u00b5l of pH8 buffer (10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.0). The peptide solution was eventually fractionated for a final of 20 fractions on an Ultimate 3000 LC system (Thermo Scientific) using reversed-phase chromatography at pH 8.0 with a 1 mm x 150 mm C18 (Thermo Scientific) column. The LC gradient lasted for 75 min LC with the range from 3-50 % of 84 % acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium acetat, pH 8.0. 12.5 \u00b5l/min was acquired as flowrate. 20 fractions were collected at 1 min intervals in concatenated manner.

MS survey scans were acquired in the Orbitrap from 300 to 1500 m/z at a resolution of 120,000 using the ambient air ion at 445.12002 m/z as lock mass. The 15 most intense ions were subjected to collision induced dissociation (CID) in the ion trap, considering a dynamic exclusion of 15 s. CID spectra were acquired with a normalized collision energy of 31 % and an activation time of 10 ms. AGC target values were set to 2x105 for Orbitrap MS and 2x104 for ion trap MSn scans, and maximum injection times were set to 300 ms.", "dataProcessingProtocol": "Bioinformatics analysis using Proteome discoverer MS raw data were analysed on Proteome Discoverer software 2.1.0.81. In a concrete manner, the raw data were searched against a concatenated target decoy version of mouse Uniprot proteome database (download on July 2015 containing 16,716 target sequences) using Mascot 2.4.1 (Matrix science). Trypsinated peptides with maximum of two missed cleaveages were selected. Carbamidomethylation of Cysteine together with oxidation of Methionine were chosen as fixed and variable modifications, respectively. MS and MS/MS tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively in accordance. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% on the PSM, peptide, and protein level was applied. The quality-controlled data was exported, and only proteins that were identified with \u22651 validated peptide were considered for data analysis. NSAF (normalized spectral abundance factor) value for each protein was calculated based on the number of PSMs (peptide spectrum matches) and the protein index\u2019s length. Nano LC-MS/MS analysis and label-free protein quantitation LC-MS/MS analysis of digested lysate was performed on an Ultimate U3000 RSLC system coupled to a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (both from Thermo). First, tryptic peptides were pre-concentrated on an Acclaim PepMap 100 \u00b5m x 2 cm, C18, 5 \u00b5m, 100 \u00c5 trap column using 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid for 5 min, at a flow rate of 20 \u00b5l/min. Next, peptide separation was carried out on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC 75 \u00b5m x 50 cm main column packed with C18 resin using a linear gradient from 97 % solvent A (0.1 % formic acid) and 3 % solvent B (84 % acetonitrile in 0.1 % formic acid) to 45 % solvent B over 100 min at a flow rate of 250 nL/min. The data acquisition mode was set to obtain one high-resolution MS scan in the FT part of the mass spectrometer at a resolution of 60,000 full width at half-maximum (at m/z 300) followed by MS/MS scans in the linear ion trap of the 10 most intense ions. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was triggered when the precursor exceeded 100 ion counts. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 60 s. The ion accumulation time was set to 300 ms (MS) and 50 ms (MS/MS). The automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 1 \u00d7 106 for MS survey scans and 1 \u00d7 105 for MS/MS scans. Data analysis of the acquired label free quantitation started with importing the MS raw file of each sample into the Progenesis Qi LC-MS software from Nonlinear Dynamics (Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K.) in which triplicate measurements of Vitamin C-treated MSC80 cells were compared to the corresponding triplicates of control MSC80 cells (Figure 1B). Progenesis Qi automatically aligned the MS raw data by selecting one of the LC-MS files as reference. Following the peak picking step, only features within 0-110 min retention time and 300-1500 m/z, with charge states of +2, +3, and +4 were considered for peptide statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and principal component analysis (PCA). MS/MS spectra exported directly from Progenesis Qi in an mgf format were subsequently searched against a decoy database of mouse proteome. The mouse proteome database was download from Uniprot in July 2015, containing 16,716 target sequences. X!Tandem Jackhammer (2015.12.15.2), MS-GF+ Beta (v10282) (12/19/2014) algorithms under the support of SearchGUI 2.7.1 and Mascot 2.4.0 (Matrix Science) search engines were applied. The research criteria were set as followed: trypsin with a maximum of two missed cleavages was selected as enzyme, carbamidomethylation of Cysteine and oxidation of Methionine were set as fixed and variable modification, respectively. Moreover, MS and MS/MS tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. PeptideShaker [22] software 1.8.1 for interpretation of peptide and protein identifications was used in which combined search results were filtered at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1 % on the protein level.

Consequently, suitable and well-characterized SC in vitro models are needed to perform appropriate pre-clinical studies including the investigation of the complex biochemical adaptations occurring in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) under different (patho)physiological conditions. MSC80 cells represent a SC line derived from mouse used in laboratories as a suitable in vitro system for neuropathological studies. As a comprehensive MSC80 protein catalogue remained elusive, here we introduce the most abundant 9532 proteins identified via mass spectrometry based protein analytics and thus provide the most comprehensive SC protein catalogue published thus far. Hereby, not only proteins causative for inherited neuropathies were covered but it has also been demonstrated that apart from cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, mitochondrial proteins and such belonging to the protein processing machinery are very well covered. Moreover, we addressed the suitability of MSC80 to examine molecular effect of a drug-treatment by analyzing the proteomic signature of Vitamin C-treated MSC80 cells. Proteomic findings along with further immunological and functional experiments support the concept of a beneficial role influence of Vitamin C on oxidative stress and identified TMX1 as an oxidative stress protective factor in SC which might represent a promising target for therapeutic intervention of PNS disorders with marked oxidative stress burden such as diabetic neuropathy.", "website": "http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006910"}, "PXD000966": {"accession": "PXD000966", "title": "CPTAC System Suitability (CompRef) Study: Proteome, PNNL", "additionalAttributes": [{"@type": "CvParam", "cvLabel": "PRIDE", "accession": "PRIDE:0000411", "name": "Dataset FTP location", "value": "ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/archive/2014/09/PXD000966"}], "projectDescription": "The objective of the \"System Suitability (CompRef) Study\" was to validate mass spectrometry protocols used at each Proteome Characterization Center (PCC).

This study focused at the development of a reliable protocol for the proteomic analysis of FFPE tissues which was followed by a pilot study using FFPE PCa clinical samples to investigate whether the optimized protocol can provide biologically relevant data in the context of PCa. Archival FFPE mouse tissues were processed using seven protein extraction protocols including combinations of homogenization means (beads, sonication, boiling) and buffers (Tris-HCl and Urea-Thiourea).

Phosphopeptids were selected by TiO2 affinity selection and, separately, using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies pY and 4g10. All affinity selected samples were analyzed without further processing. All analyses were made using LC-MS/MS performed on Thermo QExactive or Fusion Orbitrap mass spectrometers.", "dataProcessingProtocol": "Tandem mass spectra were extracted by Proteome discoverer version 1.4. Charge state deconvolution and deisotoping were not performed.  All MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version 1.4.1.14), Sequest (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA; version 1.4.1.14) and X! Tandem (The GPM, thegpm.org; version CYCLONE (2010.12.01.1)).  The Uniprot mouse complete database (downloaded 2014.06.02, 16666 entries) was searched assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin.  To ensure that each run was searched with the optimum mass tolerances, mass error was assessed in a test analysis and then search tolerances were set accordingly so that the fragment ion mass tolerance was either 0.020 Da or 0.60 Da and the parent ion tolerance was either 10.0 parts per million (ppm) or 20 ppm.  Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification.  Deamidation of asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were specified as variable modifications. In addition Glu->pyro-Glu of the n-terminus, ammonia-loss of the n-terminus and gln->pyro-Glu of the n-terminus were specified in just X! Tandem as variable modifications.  Scaffold (version 4.4.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications.  Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability.  Peptide Probabilities from X! Tandem Sequest and Mascot were assigned by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm.  Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained at least 1 identified peptide.  Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm.  Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.  Phosphorylation site assignments were made in Scaffold PTM (version 2.1.1, Proteome Software Inc.) using the A-score algorithm.  Sites that could be localized with at least 80% confidence were accepted for analysis.
