Chlamydia trachomatis ChxR is a transcriptional regulator of virulence factors that function in in vivo host pathogen interactions	To identify potential chlamydia genes that were regulated by the transcriptional enhancer chxR, we did a full proteome analysis of HeLa cells infected with the three independent chxR mutants.  This lead to the discovery of  a common set of five proteins (CT005, CT214, CT565, CT694, CT695) that were significantly down regulated in all three mutants, suggesting that their expression was regulated by chxR.  Importantly, each of the five were free of any mutations and thus were not direct targets of the EMS treatment.   	https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/FindDatasets?query=MSV000080635

Examination of matricellular fibrosis and wound healing in a model of pancreatic cancer progression	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the highest amount of stroma when compared to other solid tumors. It is now well known that the stroma plays an important role in supporting pancreatic cancer development and progression and this knowledge has led to the development of potential anti-stromal therapies, some of which have shown synergistic effect in combination with gemcitabine. Despite the acknowledgement of its importance, a granular view of how stromal composition and cross-linking change during the course of PDAC progression remains unfounded. Generally, the fibrosis that occurs in solid tumors appears to be driven primarily by increases in the abundance of fibrillar collagen, whose insolubility is determined by the formation of covalent intermolecular cross-links. Here we have used semi-quantitative proteomics and cross-linked amino acid analysis to characterize the composition and crosslinking status of normal pancreatic and PDAC stroma. In order to mimic the desmoplastic stroma observed in human disease, we utilized the genetically engineered KTC mouse model of PDAC (KrasLSL-G12D/+Tgfbr2flox/+Ptf1a-Cre). We found that highly fibrotic PDACs alter the solubility of their collagen-rich stroma through changes in the abundance of collagen cross-links and supports development of matricellular fibrosis associated with a wound healing response.	https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/FindDatasets?query=MSV000081553

Deep proteomic evaluation of primary and cell line motoneuron disease models delineates major differences in neuronal characteristics	The fatal neurodegenerative disorders amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are the most common motoneuron disease and genetic cause of infant death, respectively. Various in vitro model systems have been established to investigate motoneuron disease mechanisms - in particular immortalized cell lines and primary neurons. By quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics we here compare the proteomes of primary motoneurons to motoneuron-like cell lines NSC-34 and N2a as well as to non-neuronal control cells at a depth of 10,000 proteins. We use this resource to evaluate the suitability of murine in vitro model systems for cell biological and biochemical analysis of motoneuron disease mechanisms. Individual protein and pathway analysis indicate substantial differences between motoneuron-like cell lines and primary motoneurons, especially for proteins involved in differentiation, cytoskeleton and receptor signaling, whereas common metabolic pathways were more similar. The ALS-associated proteins themselves also showed distinct differences between cell lines and primary motoneurons, providing a molecular basis for understanding fundamental alterations between cell lines and neurons with respect to neuronal pathways with relevance for disease mechanisms. Our study provides a proteomics resource for motoneuron research and presents a paradigm of how MS-based proteomics can be used to evaluate disease model systems	https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/FindDatasets?query=MSV000084939

A critical limitation is sample input requirements that exceed many sources of clinically important material. Here we report a proteogenomics approach for core biopsies using tissue-sparing specimen processing and microscaled proteomics. As a demonstration, we analyze core needle biopsies from ERBB2 positive breast cancers before and 48-72 h after initiating neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. We show greater suppression of ERBB2 protein and both ERBB2 and mTOR target phosphosite levels in cases associated with pathological complete response, and identify potential causes of treatment resistance including the absence of ERBB2 amplification, insufficient ERBB2 activity for therapeutic sensitivity despite ERBB2 amplification, and candidate resistance mechanisms including androgen receptor signaling, mucin overexpression and an inactive immune microenvironment.

Mass spectrometry-based draft of the mouse proteome	Quantitative draft map of the proteomes of 41 healthy tissues of the animal model Mus musculus and a panel of 66 murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines and. Our in-depth analysis provides evidence for proteins encoded by >16,000 genes (~76% of the total annotated protein-coding genes), where they are expressed and in which quantities. Moreover, a widespread yet tissue- and cell type-specific phosphorylation pattern is clearly represented in our data (>50,000 sites). We further leverage our analysis by integrating the phenotypic response of a the murine PDAC cell lines panel to cancer drugs and ionizing radiation, to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying drug action and radioresistance.

Reproducible Workflow for Multiplexed Deep-Scale Proteome and Phosphoproteome Analysis of Tumor Tissues by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry	<p>Mertins P, Tang LC, Krug K, Clark DJ, Gritsenko MA, Chen L, Clauser KR, Clauss TR, Shah P, Gillette MA, et al., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0006-9" target="_blank">Nat Protoc. 2018 Jul 9. doi: 10.1038/s41596-018-0006-9</a></p><p>Here we present an optimized workflow for global proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of tissues or cell lines that uses isobaric tags (TMT (tandem mass tags)10) for multiplexed analysis and relative quantification, and provides 3x higher throughput than iTRAQ (isobaric tags for absolute and relative quantification)-4-based methods with high intra and inter-laboratory reproducibility. The workflow was systematically characterized and benchmarked across three independent laboratories using two distinct breast cancer subtypes from patient-derived xenograft models to enable assessment of proteome and phosphoproteome depth and quantitative reproducibility. Each plex consisted of ten samples, each being 300 ug of peptide derived from <50 mg of wet-weight tissue. Of the 10,000 proteins quantified per sample, we could distinguish 7,700 human proteins derived from tumor cells and 3100 mouse proteins derived from the surrounding stroma and blood. The maximum deviation across replicates and laboratories was <7%, and the inter-laboratory correlation for TMT ratio-based comparison of the two breast cancer subtypes was r &gt; 0.88. The maximum deviation for the phosphoproteome coverage was <24% across laboratories, with an average of &gt;37,000 quantified phosphosites per sample and differential quantification correlations of r &gt; 0.72. The full procedure, including sample processing and data generation, can be completed within 10 d for ten tissue samples, and 100 samples can be analyzed in ~4 months using a single LC-MS/MS instrument. The high quality, depth, and reproducibility of the data obtained both within and across laboratories should enable new biological insights to be obtained from mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses of cells and tissues together with proteogenomic data integration.</p><ul><li>Dataset imported into MassIVE from <a href="https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptac/s/S036">https://cptac-data-portal.georgetown.edu/cptac/s/S036</a> on 08/30/19</li></ul>	https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/FindDatasets?query=MSV000084265
Evaluation of NCI-7 Cell Line Panel as a Reference Material for Clinical Proteomics	Reference materials are vital to benchmarking the reproducibility of clinical tests and essential for monitoring laboratory performance for clinical proteomics. The reference material utilized for mass spectrometric analysis of the human proteome would ideally contain enough proteins to be suitably representative of the human proteome, as well as exhibit a stable protein composition in different batches of sample regeneration. Previously, The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) utilized a PDX-derived comparative reference (CompRef) materials for the longitudinal assessment of proteomic performance; however, inherent drawbacks of PDX-derived material, including extended time needed to grow tumors and high level of expertise needed, have resulted in efforts to identify a new source of CompRef material. In this study, we examined the utility of using a panel of seven cancer cell lines, NCI-7 Cell Line Panel, as a reference material for mass spectrometric analysis of human proteome. Our results showed that not only is the NCI-7 material suitable for benchmarking laboratory sample preparation methods, but also NCI-7 sample generation is highly reproducible at both the global and phosphoprotein levels. In addition, the predicted genomic and experimental coverage of the NCI-7 proteome suggests the NCI-7 material may also have applications as a universal standard proteomic reference.

The impact II, a very high resolution quadrupole time-of-flight instrument for deep shotgun proteomics	Hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) is one of the two major mass spectrometric technologies used in proteomics. Although based on simple fundamental principles, it has over the last decades greatly evolved in terms of achievable resolution, mass accuracy and dynamic range. The Bruker impact platform of QTOF instruments takes advantage of these developments and here we develop and evaluate the impact II for shotgun proteomics applications. Adaption of our heated LC system achieved very narrow peptide elution peaks. The impact II is equipped with a new collision cell with both axial and radial ion ejection, more than doubling ion extraction at high MS/MS frequencies. The new reflectron and detector improve resolving power compared to the previous model up to 80%, i.e. to 40,000 at m/z 1222. We analyzed the ion current from the inlet capillary and found very high transmission (>80%) up to the collision cell. Simulation and measurement indicated 60% transfer into the flight tube. We adapted MaxQuant for QTOF data, improving absolute average mass deviations to better than 1.45 ppm. More than 4,800 proteins can be identified in a single run of HeLa digest in a 90 min gradient. The workflow achieved high technical reproducibility (R2>0.99) and accurate fold change determination in spike-in experiments over three orders of magnitude in complex mixtures. Using label-free quantification we rapidly quantified haploid against diploid yeast and characterized overall proteome differences in mouse cell lines originated from different tissues. Finally, after high pH reversed-phase fractionation we identified 9,515 proteins in a triplicate measurement of HeLa peptide mixture and 11,257 proteins in cerebellum â�?��?? the highest proteome coverage measured with a QTOF instrument so far.	https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/FindDatasets?query=MSV000079935
Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of brown adipocytes reveals that RICTOR loss dampens global insulin/AKT signaling	Stimulating brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity represents a promising therapy for overcoming metabolic diseases. mTORC2 has been shown to be important for regulating BAT metabolism, yet its mechanism of activation is not known, nor are the identities of its downstream effectors. In this study, we apply proteomics to investigate the role of mTORC2 in brown adipocytes. To assess the role of mTORC2 in brown adipocytes, we compare wild-type controls to isogenic cells with an induced knockout of the mTORC2-specific subunit RICTOR (Rictor-iKO) by stimulating each with insulin for a 30 minute time course, and measuring the proteomes and phosphoproteomes. In Rictor-iKO cells, we identify decreases to the abundance of glycolytic and de novo lipogenesis enzymes, and increases to mitochondrial proteins as well as a set of proteins known to increase upon interferon stimulation, suggesting increased interferon-like signaling. We observe significant differences to basal phosphorylation including decreased phosphorylation of the lipid droplet protein perilipin-1 in Rictor-iKO cells and Rictor-null mouse BAT, suggesting that RICTOR could be involved with regulating basal lipolysis or droplet dynamics. And finally, we observe a general dampening of the insulin signaling response in Rictor-iKO cells. Some sites exhibit significant dependence on RICTOR, including an AKT substrate site on ATP citrate lyase, which could partially explain the previously-observed RICTOR dependence of de novo lipogenesis from glucose in BAT.	https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/FindDatasets?query=MSV000084310
